<p> Who am I, you may ask? Well, I am a candy crush loving, BgtA loving, can't wait to see my enzyme crash out loving, and protein precipitation and mass spec GOD! Although I consider myself to be a skilled scientist, I am no where near the level of Lex Col√≥n. I aspire to be half as good of a scientist as Lex (shown below).</p>

<p> When I am boiling my proteins overnight or blocking my samples with 2 eqv IAA and 1 eqv DTT, I wonder what it would be like to be a molecule in the mass spec. I picture myself as a glycopeptide being tossed around in the quadrupole and blasted into pieces by electrons.</p>

<p> People think that the Milky Way galaxy orbits around a super massive black hole, but little do they know, it is actually South Korea.</p>
